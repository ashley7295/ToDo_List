## ToDo List aka Calendar Program

This program is meant to make a list of things to do. It categorizes it by when it is due, the level of Priority, if it is Required or not, the type of task it is, and then lets the user add notes if they want. 

This is similar to a Calendar app where a user can add tasks to a specific day, but in list form. 

I wanted to include a list of completed tasks because i think it's just as important to see what you've accomplished as it is to see whats ahead.
The user will be able to Add, Delete, or Complete an Item. as well as Quit the program all together. 

The GUI also displays the current Date to make Planning easier for the user as well as messages after an action has been preformed.


The database is called **todo** with the tables being **description**, **dueDate**, **priority**, **required**, **type**, **notes**.
